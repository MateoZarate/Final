        <h1>The Beginning</h1>
        <p>It had been about 2 years after moving to Minnesota, when I started my first martial art. I was about 4 years old when I started <span class="tooltip">Karate<span class="tooltiptext">An Asian system of unarmed combat using the hands and feet to deliver and block blows, widely practiced as a sport. It was formalized in Okinawa in the 17th century and popularized via Japan after about 1920. Karate is performed barefoot in loose padded clothing, with a colored belt indicating the level of skill, and involves mental as well as physical training.</span></span>. I wasn't the biggest fan of karate at first. I was never really interested, sense it was something my parents made me do. I would already began sparing at a young age because of karate. At around the age of 6 I left karate behind and moved to Colorado.</p>

        <h1>Gaining Interest</h1>
        <p>After I settled in Colorado, I picked another martial art. This time it was <span class="tooltip">Jiu Jistu<span class="tooltiptext">Jujutsu, also known as jiu-jitsu and ju-jitsu, is a family of Japanese martial arts and a system of close combat that can be used in a defensive or offensive manner to kill or subdue one or more weaponless or armed and armored opponents.</span></span>. I was around 6 years old when I began Jiu Jistu. After a few years of training, I began to outgrow the kids, and had to train with adults. Training with adults definitely helped my boost my skill and experience in Jiu Jistu. I stopped training Jiu Jistu as Covid hit. I trained Jiu Jistu for about 7 years.</p>

        <h1>The Present</h1>
        <p >Late summer of 2021 was when I got back into martial arts, since Covid started. I began looking around for a <span class="tooltip">Kickboxing<span class="tooltiptext">Kickboxing is a group of stand-up combat sports and a form of boxing based on kicking and punching. The combat takes place in a boxing ring, normally with boxing gloves, mouthguards, shorts, and bare feet to favor the use of kicks. Kickboxing is practiced for self-defense, general fitness, or for competition.</span></span> gym, and eventaully found one. The gym I found also offered classes for <span class="tooltip">Muay Thai<span class="tooltiptext">Muay Thai, sometimes referred to as Thai boxing, is a martial art and combat sport that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques. This discipline is known as the "art of eight limbs", as it is characterised by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees and shins.</span></span>, but to take them you had to reach a certain level of experience first. I did Kickboxing for a few months, and began ranking up. Eventaully, after a few months, I was able to take the Muay Thai classes. I started Muay Thai during Feb/Mar and have been training ever since.</p>
